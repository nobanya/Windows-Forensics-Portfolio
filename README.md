# Windows Forensics Projects 

This repository documents my hands-on work completing a series of Windows forensics projects. The goal of this collection is to demonstrate practical skills used to investigate Windows systems, analyze forensic artifacts, and identify indicators of malicious activity in real-world scenarios.

These projects focus on core digital forensics techniques commonly used in SOC, incident response, and DFIR roles.

## Projects Completed

1. [Window Event Log Analysis For Incident Response](https://github.com/nobanya/Windows-Forensics-Portfolio/blob/a8bc82dfe69c692dd9a940536fa83dce2d83108f/Windows-Event-Log-Analysis-For-IR.md)
2. [Windows Registry Forensics For Threat Detection]()
3. [Forensic Examination of Windows File Systems & Artifacts]()
4. [Browser Artifacts Extraction & Analysis on Windows]()
5. [Deleted Files Recovery & ANalysis on Windows Systems]()
